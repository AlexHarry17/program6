CSCI 232 Program 3 by Alex Harry, Cory Johns, Justin Keeling.
Program reads in a graph containing an adjacency matrix from the input file at ./input/input.csv
and repeats the following until there are no more graphs remaining in the input:
    - prints the graph
    - runs Prim’s Algorithm and prints the edges in the minimum spanning tree
    - runs kruskal’s Algorithm and prints the edges in the minimum spanning tree
    - runs Floyd-Warshall's Algorithm and prints every step in finding all the shortest paths
